NOTES/LEFT TO DO:

- clear sign up form on successful user registration
- ask confirmation before deleting an account
- ask confirmation before deleting a post
- work in progress boolean when adding a project
    (conditional render the barricade tape image)
- hide 'sign up' header on successful sign up
- change link to /signup to component in log in form

-accessing studio page without being signed in does not redirect to /login, as i had hoped

- client side validation may be less strict than server side

- add 'please log in to access this conent' page instead of directing to log in

- add ability to update username (get user info by id)

- navbar toggle close on click

- figure out how you want to handle social icons -- i guess it's conditional like the photo -- maybe very light gray and dark gray if linked

- dynamically populate year options from Date.now. getFullYear - going back 100 years or so

- do :hover link syling in navbar

- look how to .join for project tags

- restrictedRouteAccess isn't working on /posts -- had to take it off to view on client side

- dont think cookie is expiring correctly (ever)

- add validation to characters of username (for URL)
    ( allowed characters = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-._~:/?#[]@!$&'()*+,;=)
    /^([!#$&-;=?-[]_a-z~]|%[0-9a-fA-F]{2})+$/

- take character limit off description in single page
