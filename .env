- client side validation may be less strict than server side

- add 'please log in to access this conent' page instead of directing to log in

- add ability to update username (get user info by id)

- navbar toggle close on click

- figure out how you want to handle social icons -- i guess it's conditional like the photo -- maybe very light gray and dark gray if linked

- dynamically populate year options from Date.now. getFullYear - going back 100 years or so

- do :hover link syling in navbar

- look how to .join for project tags
